Visual Studio is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). It's a place where you can code even 
when you're offline. I works best for new learners as it's interface is good, helps to debug too and
 you can use multiple languages in this IDE. It is as easy to set up as ABC. You just need a P.C and
 some knowledge of some coding language. All you have to to do is click on this link provided below. Click 
 Windows if you use Windows and Mac if You use Mac. Just continue to click on next and then install it, it 
 just takes a minute or two to do this whole process. And lastly, in the link there will be a download 
 button on top-right, just don't click it, click on your computer system either windows or mac.

    The console is a place where hidden information is shown if you want to write any. So "hidden" means it's
     not confidential but it can not be seen on the main webpage. You can print different values
     on the console using javascript language. Just create a variable and enter a value in it, then write 
     console.log(name of variable). It's easy to open too. The steps are given below.
